<h3>This is my going-back-to-the-coding-world project. I started coding about 4 years ago but then I stopped for sometime. Now that I'm back, I thought about making a new project that is filled with inside jokes for my friend group. This project was started on a program that saved changes locally then when finished was transferred to Github.</h3>

<p>I had lots of fun solving problems as I went; it truly was a wonderful experience to have.</p>

I always like looking back at this project. It really shows how much my knowledge has grown since the creation of this project.
